                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Joel Roy, a Computer Engineering student with a passion for artificial
                    intelligence, deep learning, and software development.</p>

                <p>Along with my work in AI, I have a strong foundation in web development using HTML, CSS, and
                    Bootstrap. I also have some experience working with databases like PostgreSQL and SQLite, which I
                    apply to my projects where data management is key.</p>

                <p>I'm always eager to learn and grow in the tech space, and you can explore more about my projects in
                    the "Project" section, where I showcase my work on AI-driven crop disease prediction systems, Google
                    Maps clones(It's my final year project work is going on), and much more.</p>

                <p>Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate on exciting tech-driven projects!</p>
